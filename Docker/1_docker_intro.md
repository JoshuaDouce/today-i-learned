# Introduction to Docker

Docker is an open-source platform designed to help developers build, ship, and run applications in lightweight, portable containers. It simplifies the process of managing dependencies and deploying applications across different environments.

## Core Concepts

### 🧱 Docker Images
- A Docker image is a snapshot of an application and its environment.
- It contains everything needed to run the app: code, runtime, libraries, and configuration.
- Images are built using a `Dockerfile` and are immutable once created.

### 📦 Containers
- A container is a running instance of a Docker image.
- Containers are isolated, lightweight, and start almost instantly.
- They share the host OS kernel but run independently of one another.

### 🌐 Registries
- Docker images are stored in registries, like [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) or private registries.
- Registries allow you to version, share, and distribute images easily.
- `docker pull` and `docker push` are used to retrieve or upload images to/from a registry.

## When to Use Docker

You might choose Docker when:
- You want to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- You need to isolate dependencies for different apps or services.
- You're building microservices architectures.
- You want to simplify deployment and scaling processes.
- You're working in CI/CD pipelines and want reproducible builds.
- You want to do a spike on new technologies without affecting your local setup.

## Summary

Docker makes it easy to package applications with all their dependencies into containers, ensuring they work seamlessly across different systems. It’s especially powerful for teams working on complex systems or deploying to multiple environments.
