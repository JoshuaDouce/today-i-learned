# 🚀 Kubernetes Learning Roadmap (with k9s, Flux, Kustomize, etc.)

A step-by-step guide to mastering Kubernetes and related tools like `k9s`, `Flux`, and `Kustomize`, with a focus on real-world usage and best practices.

---

## 🧱 Phase 1: Core Kubernetes Fundamentals

### 🎯 Goal:
Understand how Kubernetes works and how to deploy/manage applications.

### ✅ Steps:
- Learn core concepts:
  - Pods, Deployments, Services, Namespaces
  - ConfigMaps, Secrets, Volumes
- Practice using:
  - [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)
  - [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/)
- Use `kubectl` to:
  - Create and manage deployments
  - Scale apps
  - Perform rolling updates

### 📚 Resources:
- [Kubernetes Official Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/)
- *The Kubernetes Book* by Nigel Poulton
- *Kubernetes in Action* by Marko Luksa

## 🖥️ Phase 2: Dashboard & CLI Tools

### 🎯 Goal:
Efficiently manage clusters with user-friendly tools.

### ✅ Tools:
- **k9s** – Terminal UI to explore and manage K8s
- **Lens** (optional GUI)

---

## ⚙️ Phase 3: GitOps & Configuration Management

### 🎯 Goal:
Embrace declarative configuration and GitOps workflows.

### ✅ Tools:
- **Kustomize**
  - Build layered configurations (dev/staging/prod)
- **Flux**
  - Use Git as the source of truth for your K8s deployments
  - Automate reconciliation and deploy changes from Git

### ✅ Optional:
- **Argo CD** – UI-focused alternative to Flux

---

## 🛠️ Phase 4: Real-World Projects & Best Practices

### 🎯 Goal:
Apply your knowledge to realistic, production-like environments.

### ✅ Project Ideas:
- Deploy a multi-tier or microservice app
- Add CI/CD with GitHub Actions + Flux
- Add observability: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki

### ✅ Best Practices:
- Use RBAC, Network Policies
- Use tools like:
  - Sealed Secrets or External Secrets
  - Helm (if you want templating)
  - Tilt/Skaffold for local dev
