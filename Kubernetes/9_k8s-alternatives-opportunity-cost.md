## 🌐 Kubernetes Alternatives: Overview

| Category                    | Examples                                            | Description                                                                |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔧 **Fully Managed K8s**     | AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Azure AKS                         | You use Kubernetes, but the control plane is managed for you.              |
| ☁️ **Serverless Platforms**  | AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions | Run code without managing infrastructure or containers.                    |
| 📦 **Serverless Containers** | AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Apps | Deploy containerized apps without managing servers or orchestrators.       |
| 🧱 **PaaS Platforms**        | Heroku, Render, Railway, Vercel, Netlify            | Abstracts away both containers and orchestration; you deploy code or apps. |
| 🔁 **Other Orchestrators**   | Nomad (by HashiCorp), Docker Swarm                  | Alternatives to Kubernetes for container orchestration.                    |

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- **Kubernetes = Power + Complexity.** Great for when you need fine-grained control, hybrid deployments, or extensibility.
- **Serverless = Simplicity + Lock-in.** Ideal for fast-moving projects or low-maintenance infrastructure — but with limited portability.
- **PaaS = Dev Speed.** Great for startups or MVPs where time-to-market matters more than control.
- **Other orchestrators = Niche.** Valid in specific orgs but not widely adopted or supported.
