- TDD Feedback on design
  - Tests hard to write maybe theres a design problem
- Code Quality/Manage complexity
  - Modularity
  - Seperation of concerns
  - High Cohesions
  - Abstraction
  - Appropiate coupling

# Feedback in Architecture
- Testability and Deployabbility
- Optimized monolothic system
- Break into deployable units

# Feedback in Product Design
- Continous delivery of useful ideas into production
- Feedback from users
- Telemetry

# Feedback in Organization & Culture
