# Fundamentals of an Engineering Approach

## The Importance of Measurement

- velocity irrelevant? In my experience maybe it depends on experience of the team as a whole.
- Lines of code - yes, useless.
- Test coverage - It depends, it can help idnetify potentials gaps but is by no meanas a measure of quality and effectiveness of a team.
- Stability - How do you measure this? Bugs found in production?
  - Change failure rate - the rate at which changes fail in production.
  - Recovery failure time - How long to recover from a failure?
- Throughput - How do you measure this in software? Number of features delivered? Number of bugs fixed?
  - Lead time - how long from idea to production?
  - Frequency - How often changes go to production?
- Continous Delivery? - Teams practicing this have a high correlation with 'high performance'.
- Small teams - Improves communication and collaboration.
- What about builgint the right thing and not just building things right?
- 'You can have speed or quality' - Not true in software both in theory and in my experience.
  - The route to speed is high quality, the route to high quality is speed of feedback.


## Applying Stability and Throughput

- Use them to evaluate changes to 
  - Process
  - Organization
  - Culture
  - Technology
- Trade off between stability and throughput?
    - Example - UAT Testing step, slows throuhgput but increases stability?
    - Example - CAB aim to increase stability but slows throughput and arguably reduces stability.
