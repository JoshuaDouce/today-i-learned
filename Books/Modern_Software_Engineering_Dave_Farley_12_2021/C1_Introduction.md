# Modern Software Engineering - Introduction

## Engineering - The Practical Application of Science

**SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT** is the process of discovery & exploration. To succeed we need to be experts at learning and optimize our solutions for learning.

### Basis Scientific Method
- Characterize
- Hypothesize
- Predict
- Experiment

Aim for consitent and reliable results.
Be skeptical.

**SOFTWARE ENGINEERING** application of empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient & economic solutions to practical problems in software.

Aim to be expert in learing and managing complexity.

### Experts at Learning
- Iteration
- Feedback
- Incrementalism
- Experimentation
- Empiricism

### Managing Complexity
- Modularity
- Cohesion
- Separtion of Concerns
- Abstraction
- Loose Coupling

### Effective Strategy fo Software Development
- Testability
- Deployability
- Speed
- Controlling the Variables
- Continous Delivery
- Why?
  - Enjoyment at work
  - Less stress
  - Work life balance
